                    aware that such action could affect the availability and

                    rendered ineffective by declining all cookies or by
                    modifying your web browser’s settings to notify you each
                    time a cookie is tendered, permitting you to accept or

                <h1>Policy for Children</h1>
                <p>
                    BII itself does not provide services directly to children,
                    but practitioners often help children with a variety of
                    services. Despite this, BII does not knowingly solicit
                    information from or market to children under the age of 13.
                    Rather, we work to conduct all business and online
                    transactions with parents. If you become aware of any
                    advertising or efforts directed at children under age 13,
                    please contact us using the contact information provided
                    below. Also, you agree to not provide any healthcare
                    information on or through this Site. Only provide healthcare
                    information to practitioners in appropriate, private
                    settings to help safeguard your and your child’s health
                    information. We do not knowingly use any information about
                    children under age 13 for marketing or solicitation
                    purposes. If a child under age 13 is enrolled by a parent or
                    guardian in an event or other service, the child’s personal
                    information will be used to identify them in that particular
                    event and may be shared with the practitioner or presenter
                    as necessary. However, the personal information of a child
                    under age 13 will not otherwise be knowingly used by us. We
                    do not knowingly send advertisements to children under age
                    13, but instead communicate with the child’s parent or
                    guardian and use the parent’s or guardian’s information in
                    accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you become aware of
                    any use of the personal information of a child under age 13
                    outside the scope of an event or service the child is
                    enrolled in, please contact us using the contact information
